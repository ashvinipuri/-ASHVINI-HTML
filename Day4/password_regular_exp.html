  // Each () represent a character. The pattern ^$()()()/$ ensures that the password meets the following criteria:
  // (.) means each character can be any letter, digit, or special character.
  // {4,12} means min 4 and max 12 characters.
  // (?=.*) means  each char onwards must have at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character.
